- **Git**: Version control

### Optional Tools

- **Pandoc**: For EPUB generation
- **Calibre**: For MOBI generation
- **Latexmk**: For continuous builds
- **ChkTeX**: LaTeX linter

### Editor Setup

Any text editor works, but these are recommended:

- **VS Code** with LaTeX Workshop extension
- **TeXstudio**: Dedicated LaTeX editor
- **Emacs/Vim** with LaTeX plugins

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Or: git checkout -b fix/issue-number
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/chapter-XX-topic` - New content
- `fix/issue-123` - Bug fixes
- `docs/improve-readme` - Documentation
- `refactor/chapter-reorganization` - Restructuring

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Edit the relevant `.tex` files
- Add code examples to `code-examples/`
- Add figures to `figures/`
- Update bibliography in `backmatter/references.bib` if needed

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
make pdf         # Build and check for errors
make validate    # Check LaTeX syntax (if chktex installed)
```

### 4. Commit Changes

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

See [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) section for guidelines.

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Style Guidelines

### LaTeX Style

1. **Line length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
2. **One sentence per line**: Makes diffs cleaner
3. **Consistent indentation**: Use spaces, not tabs
4. **Section structure**: Follow existing chapter structure

### Writing Style

1. **Clear and concise**: Avoid unnecessary jargon
2. **Define terms**: Explain technical terms when first used
3. **Active voice**: Prefer active over passive voice
4. **Examples**: Include concrete examples
5. **Progressive difficulty**: Start simple, build complexity

### Code Style

1. **Complete examples**: Code should compile/run
2. **Well-commented**: Explain what and why, not just what
3. **Consistent formatting**: Follow existing code style
4. **Error handling**: Show proper error handling
5. **C language**: Primary language is C for Wayland examples

Example code style:

```c
// Good: Well-commented, clear
static void surface_enter(void *data,
                         struct wl_surface *surface,
                         struct wl_output *output) {
    // Surface entered a new output
    struct app_state *app = data;
    app->current_output = output;
    
    // Update scale factor based on output
    update_scale_factor(app);
}

// Avoid: No comments, unclear
static void surface_enter(void *d, struct wl_surface *s, struct wl_output *o) {
    ((struct app_state *)d)->current_output = o;
    update_scale_factor(d);
}
```

## Commit Messages

### Format

```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain what and why, not how (the code shows how).

- Bullet points are fine
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues: Fixes #123
```

### Examples

Good commit messages:
```
Add chapter on DRM/KMS integration

Explains Direct Rendering Manager and Kernel Mode Setting,
including practical examples of mode-setting and page flipping.

Fixes #45
```

```
Fix typo in security model chapter

Changed "compsoitor" to "compositor" in section 7.2.
```

```
Improve buffer management code example

Previous example didn't show proper release handling.
Added listener for buffer release events.
```
